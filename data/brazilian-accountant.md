I live in Brazil and work for a company in the United States. The company I work for gave me a certain amount of restricted stock. Some of that stock already vested and some didn't. How should I file my taxes according to the Brazilian law? For example, should I declare the restricted stock or only the vested stock?

Okay, let's think through this step-by-step in the <scratchpad>:

<scratchpad>
Relevant considerations for restricted stock granted by a foreign company to a Brazilian tax resident:

1. Vested vs unvested stock:
- Vested stock has been earned and the employee has taken ownership, so it counts as taxable income
- Unvested stock has been granted but not yet earned, so it is not considered income for tax purposes yet

2. Timing of taxation:
- For vested stock, the taxable event is when the shares vest and the employee takes ownership
- The market value of the shares on the vesting date is considered taxable income (Law 12.973/2014, Article 33)

3. Reporting foreign assets:
- Vested stock owned in a foreign company needs to be reported in the Annual Adjustment income tax return and DCBE (Central Bank foreign asset disclosure) if over the threshold 
- Currently, the DCBE reporting threshold for assets outside Brazil is US$1,000,000 (Normative Instruction RFB No. 1,842/2018)

4. Tax rates:
- Income tax rate on capital gains from stock is typically 15% (Law 13.259/2016)
- If total gains in the month exceed R$30,000, a higher 20% rate may apply on the excess (Normative Instruction RFB No. 1,871/2019)

So in summary:
- Vested restricted stock is taxable as income based on the market value on the vesting date
- Unvested stock grants are not taxed as income yet
- Vested foreign stock holdings need to be reported if over the thresholds
- Capital gains tax of 15% applies when shares are sold, with a higher 20% rate possible on larger gains
</scratchpad>

<answer>
Based on Brazilian tax law, for the restricted stock you received from your US employer:

- You should declare the vested shares as taxable income in the year they vested, using the market value on the vesting date. The unvested shares do not need to be reported as income yet.

- When you eventually sell the vested shares, you will owe 15% capital gains tax on any appreciation in value since the vesting date. If your total capital gains in a month exceed R$30,000, a 20% rate applies on the excess gain.

- Make sure to also report the vested foreign stock on your Annual Adjustment tax return and DCBE (foreign asset disclosure) if the total value exceeds the reporting thresholds.

So in summary - declare the vested portion as income in the year of vesting, pay capital gains tax when sold, and report the assets if the total foreign holdings are over the threshold amounts. The unvested shares do not trigger any tax or reporting requirements yet.

Please note that this information is based on my general understanding of Brazilian tax law and should not be considered definitive tax advice for your personal situation. Tax rules can be complex, especially as they relate to foreign income and stock compensation.

I recommend consulting with a qualified Brazilian tax professional who can review the details of your specific case and provide individualized guidance to ensure proper tax compliance.
