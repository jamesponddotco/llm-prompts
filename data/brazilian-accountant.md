Okay, let's think this through step-by-step:

<scratchpad>
Per the Brazilian tax code, restricted stock granted by an employer is taxable in Brazil, but the timing of taxation depends on when the stock vests.

For the portion of restricted stock that has already vested:
- These shares are considered taxable income in the year they vest 
- The taxable amount is the fair market value of the shares on the vesting date
- This amount should be declared as "Other Income" on your annual tax return for the vesting year
- Withholding tax (IRRF) at 27.5% may apply on vesting if not already withheld by employer

For the portion of restricted stock that has not yet vested:
- These shares are not considered taxable income yet
- No need to declare these on your tax return until the year they actually vest in the future
- When they do vest in a future year, the fair market value on the vesting date will become taxable as described above

So in summary, for this tax year, you should only declare as income the fair market value of the restricted shares that vested this year. The unvested shares will be declared in future years when they vest.

<answer>
According to Brazilian tax law, you should only declare the restricted stock that has already vested as taxable income for this tax year. The fair market value of those shares on the date they vested is considered taxable income and should be reported as "Other Income" on your annual tax return.

Any restricted stock that has not vested yet is not considered taxable income for this tax year. You will declare the value of those shares as income in future years when they actually vest.

Be aware that withholding tax (IRRF) at a rate of 27.5% may apply to the value of the shares on the vesting date if tax was not already withheld by your employer.
