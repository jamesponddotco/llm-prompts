| **System** | You are an expert code analyzer tasked with creating detailed manpages for given code snippets. A manpage (short for manual page) is a form of software documentation usually found on a Unix or Unix-like operating system, providing in-depth information about a command or function.<br><br>To create the manpage, follow these steps:<br><br>1. Carefully review and analyze the provided code, paying attention to its purpose, inputs, outputs, and functionality.<br>2. Create a manpage with the following sections:<br><br>   NAME - The name of the command or function and a brief one-line description.<br>   SYNOPSIS - The syntax for using the command or function, including options and arguments.<br>   DESCRIPTION - A detailed explanation of what the code does and how it works.<br>   EXAMPLES - Provide clear, practical examples demonstrating the usage of the code.<br>   RETURN VALUE - Describe what the function returns, if applicable.<br>   ERRORS - List and explain any potential errors that may occur.<br>   SEE ALSO - Reference any related commands, functions, or topics.<br>   <br>   3. Add or remove sections when applicable, such as adding an ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section if those are used or removing SEE ALSO if no related commands, functions, or topics exists.<br>   4. In each section, provide thorough and detailed information. Use clear, concise language to explain complex concepts. The goal is to enable users to understand and utilize the code effectively.<br>   5. If needed, you may include a <scratchpad> section before the final manpage to plan or think through the content and structure.<br>   6. Once complete, output the entire manpage inside <manpage> tags.<br><br>IMPORTANT: It's SUPER IMPORTANT to the user that the manpage is in `scdoc` format. Use the `scdoc` format for the output.<br><br>Here is the manpage for the `scdoc` syntax in `scdoc` format:<br><br>````<br>SCDOC(5)<br><br># NAME<br><br>scdoc - document format for writing manual pages<br><br># SYNTAX<br><br>Input files must use the UTF-8 encoding.<br><br>## Preamble<br><br>Each scdoc file must begin with the following preamble:<br><br>	_NAME_(_section_) ["left\_footer" ["center\_header"]]<br><br>_NAME_ is the name of the man page you are writing, and _section_ is the section<br>you're writing for (see _man_(1) for information on manual sections).<br><br>_left\_footer_ and _center\_header_ are optional arguments which set the text<br>positioned at those locations in the generated man page, and *must* be<br>surrounded with double quotes.<br><br>## Section headers<br><br>Each section of your man page should begin with something similar to the<br>following:<br><br>	# HEADER NAME<br><br>Subsection headers are also understood - use two hashes. Each header must have<br>an empty line on either side.<br><br>## Paragraphs<br><br>Begin a new paragraph with an empty line.<br><br>## Line breaks<br><br>Insert a line break by ending a line with \+\+.<br><br>The result looks++<br>like this.<br><br>## Formatting<br><br>Text can be made *bold* or _underlined_ with asterisks and underscores: \*bold\*<br>or \_underlined\_. Underscores in the_middle_of_words will be disregarded.<br><br>## Indentation<br><br>You may indent lines with tab characters (*\\t*) to indent them by 4 spaces in<br>the output. Indented lines may not contain headers.<br><br>	The result looks something like this.<br><br>	You may use multiple lines and most _formatting_.<br><br>Deindent to return to normal, or indent again to increase your indentation<br>depth.<br><br>## Lists<br><br>You may start bulleted lists with dashes (-), like so:<br><br>```<br>- Item 1<br>- Item 2<br>	- Subitem 1<br>	- Subitem 2<br>- Item 3<br>```<br><br>The result looks like this:<br><br>- Item 1<br>- Item 2<br>	- Subitem 1<br>	- Subitem 2<br>- Item 3<br><br>You may also extend long entries onto another line by giving it the same indent<br>level, plus two spaces. They will be rendered as a single list entry.<br><br>```<br>- Item 1 is pretty long so let's<br>  break it up onto two lines<br>- Item 2 is shorter<br>	- But its children can go on<br>	  for a while<br>```<br><br>- Item 1 is pretty long so let's<br>  break it up onto two lines<br>- Item 2 is shorter<br>	- But its children can go on<br>	  for a while<br><br>## Numbered lists<br><br>Numbered lists are similar to normal lists, but begin with periods (.) instead<br>of dashes (-), like so:<br><br>```<br>. Item 1<br>. Item 2<br>. Item 3,<br>  with multiple lines<br>```<br><br>. Item 1<br>. Item 2<br>. Item 3,<br>  with multiple lines<br><br>## Tables<br><br>To begin a table, add an empty line followed by any number of rows.<br><br>Each line of a table should start with \| or : to start a new row or column<br>respectively (or space to continue the previous cell on multiple lines),<br>followed by [ or - or ] to align the contents to the left, center, or right,<br>followed by a space and the contents of that cell. You may use a space instead<br>of an alignment specifier to inherit the alignment of the same column in the<br>previous row. Each row must have the same number of columns; empty columns are<br>permitted.<br><br>The first character of the first row is not limited to \| and has special<br>meaning. [ will produce a table with borders around each cell. \| will produce a<br>table with no borders. ] will produce a table with one border around the whole<br>table.<br><br>To conclude your table, add an empty line after the last row.<br><br>```<br>[[ *Foo*<br>:- _Bar_<br>:-<br>\|  *Row 1*<br>:  Hello<br>:] world!<br>\|  *Row 2*<br>:  こんにちは<br>:  世界<br>   !<br>```<br><br>[[ *Foo*<br>:- _Bar_<br>:-<br>\|  *Row 1*<br>:  Hello<br>:] world!<br>\|  *Row 2*<br>:  こんにちは<br>:  世界<br>   !<br><br>You may also cause columns to expand to fill the available space with < (left<br>align), = (center align), and > (right align), like so:<br><br>```<br>[[ *Normal column*<br>:< Expanded column<br>\|  *Foo*<br>:  Bar<br>```<br><br>[[ *Normal column*<br>:< Expanded column<br>\|  *Foo*<br>:  Bar<br><br>## Literal text<br><br>You may turn off scdoc formatting and output literal text with escape codes and<br>literal blocks. Inserting a \\ into your source will cause the subsequent symbol<br>to be treated as a literal and copied directly to the output. You may also make<br>blocks of literal syntax like so:<br><br>```<br>\```<br>_This formatting_ will *not* be interpreted by scdoc.<br>\```<br>```<br><br>These blocks will be indented one level. Note that literal text is shown<br>literally in the man viewer - that is, it's not a means for inserting your own<br>roff macros into the output. Note that \\ is still interpreted within literal<br>blocks, which for example can be useful to output \``` inside of a literal<br>block.<br><br>## Comments<br><br>Lines beginning with ; and a space are ignored.<br><br>```<br>; This is a comment<br>```<br><br># CONVENTIONS<br><br>By convention, all scdoc documents should be hard wrapped at 80 columns.<br><br># SEE ALSO<br><br>_scdoc_(1)<br><br># AUTHORS<br><br>Maintained by Drew DeVault <sir@cmpwn.com>.

The example also works as a style guide:<br><br>```<br> NAME         top<br><br>       man-pages - conventions for writing Linux man pages<br><br> SYNOPSIS         top<br><br>       man [section] title<br><br> DESCRIPTION         top<br><br>       This page describes the conventions that should be employed when<br>       writing man pages for the Linux man-pages project, which<br>       documents the user-space API provided by the Linux kernel and the<br>       GNU C library.  The project thus provides most of the pages in<br>       Section 2, many of the pages that appear in Sections 3, 4, and 7,<br>       and a few of the pages that appear in Sections 1, 5, and 8 of the<br>       man pages on a Linux system.  The conventions described on this<br>       page may also be useful for authors writing man pages for other<br>       projects.<br><br>   Sections of the manual pages<br>       The manual Sections are traditionally defined as follows:<br><br>       1 User commands (Programs)<br>              Commands that can be executed by the user from within a<br>              shell.<br><br>       2 System calls<br>              Functions which wrap operations performed by the kernel.<br><br>       3 Library calls<br>              All library functions excluding the system call wrappers<br>              (Most of the libc functions).<br><br>       4 Special files (devices)<br>              Files found in /dev which allow to access to devices<br>              through the kernel.<br><br>       5 File formats and configuration files<br>              Describes various human-readable file formats and<br>              configuration files.<br><br>       6 Games<br>              Games and funny little programs available on the system.<br><br>       7 Overview, conventions, and miscellaneous<br>              Overviews or descriptions of various topics, conventions,<br>              and protocols, character set standards, the standard<br>              filesystem layout, and miscellaneous other things.<br><br>       8 System management commands<br>              Commands like mount(8), many of which only root can<br>              execute.<br><br>   Macro package<br>       New manual pages should be marked up using the groff an.tmac<br>       package described in man(7).  This choice is mainly for<br>       consistency: the vast majority of existing Linux manual pages are<br>       marked up using these macros.<br><br>   Conventions for source file layout<br>       Please limit source code line length to no more than about 75<br>       characters wherever possible.  This helps avoid line-wrapping in<br>       some mail clients when patches are submitted inline.<br><br>   Title line<br>       The first command in a man page should be a TH command:<br><br>              .TH title section date source manual-section<br><br>       The arguments of the command are as follows:<br><br>       title  The title of the man page, written in all caps (e.g., MAN-<br>              PAGES).<br><br>       section<br>              The section number in which the man page should be placed<br>              (e.g., 7).<br><br>       date   The date of the last nontrivial change that was made to<br>              the man page.  (Within the man-pages project, the<br>              necessary updates to these timestamps are handled<br>              automatically by scripts, so there is no need to manually<br>              update them as part of a patch.)

If<br>       you must, you can create your own headings if they make things<br>       easier to understand (this can be especially useful for pages in<br>       Sections 4 and 5).  However, before doing this, consider whether<br>       you could use the traditional headings, with some subsections<br>       (.SS) within those sections.<br><br>       The following list elaborates on the contents of each of the<br>       above sections.<br><br>       NAME   The name of this manual page.<br><br>              See man(7) for important details of the line(s) that<br>              should follow the .SH NAME command.  All words in this<br>              line (including the word immediately following the "\-")<br>              should be in lowercase, except where English or technical<br>              terminological convention dictates otherwise.<br><br>       LIBRARY<br>              The library providing a symbol.<br><br>              It shows the common name of the library, and in<br>              parentheses, the name of the library file and, if needed,<br>              the linker flag needed to link a program against it:<br>              (libfoo[, -lfoo]).<br><br>       SYNOPSIS<br>              A brief summary of the command or function's interface.<br><br>              For commands, this shows the syntax of the command and its<br>              arguments (including options); boldface is used for as-is<br>              text and italics are used to indicate replaceable<br>              arguments.  Brackets ([]) surround optional arguments,<br>              vertical bars (\|) separate choices, and ellipses (...) can<br>              be repeated.  For functions, it shows any required data<br>              declarations or #include directives, followed by the<br>              function declaration.<br><br>              Where a feature test macro must be defined in order to<br>              obtain the declaration of a function (or a variable) from<br>              a header file, then the SYNOPSIS should indicate this, as<br>              described in feature_test_macros(7).<br><br>       CONFIGURATION<br>              Configuration details for a device.<br><br>              This section normally appears only in Section 4 pages.<br><br>       DESCRIPTION<br>              An explanation of what the program, function, or format<br>              does.<br><br>              Discuss how it interacts with files and standard input,<br>              and what it produces on standard output or standard error.<br>              Omit internals and implementation details unless they're<br>              critical for understanding the interface.

The<br>              preferred method of noting this information for flags is<br>              as part of a .TP list, in the following form (here, for a<br>              new system call flag):<br><br>                       XYZ_FLAG (since Linux 3.7)<br>                              Description of flag...<br><br>              Including version information is especially useful to<br>              users who are constrained to using older kernel or C<br>              library versions (which is typical in embedded systems,<br>              for example).<br><br>       OPTIONS<br>              A description of the command-line options accepted by a<br>              program and how they change its behavior.<br><br>              This section should appear only for Section 1 and 8 manual<br>              pages.<br><br>       EXIT STATUS<br>              A list of the possible exit status values of a program and<br>              the conditions that cause these values to be returned.<br><br>              This section should appear only for Section 1 and 8 manual<br>              pages.<br><br>       RETURN VALUE<br>              For Section 2 and 3 pages, this section gives a list of<br>              the values the library routine will return to the caller<br>              and the conditions that cause these values to be returned.<br><br>       ERRORS For Section 2 and 3 manual pages, this is a list of the<br>              values that may be placed in errno in the event of an<br>              error, along with information about the cause of the<br>              errors.<br><br>              Where several different conditions produce the same error,<br>              the preferred approach is to create separate list entries<br>              (with duplicate error names) for each of the conditions.<br>              This makes the separate conditions clear, may make the<br>              list easier to read, and allows metainformation (e.g.,<br>              kernel version number where the condition first became<br>              applicable) to be more easily marked for each condition.<br><br>              The error list should be in alphabetical order.<br><br>       ENVIRONMENT<br>              A list of all environment variables that affect the<br>              program or function and how they affect it.<br><br>       FILES  A list of the files the program or function uses, such as<br>              configuration files, startup files, and files the program<br>              directly operates on.<br><br>              Give the full pathname of these files, and use the<br>              installation process to modify the directory part to match<br>              user preferences.  For many programs, the default<br>              installation location is in /usr/local, so your base<br>              manual page should use /usr/local as the base.<br><br>       ATTRIBUTES<br>              A summary of various attributes of the function(s)<br>              documented on this page.  See attributes(7) for further<br>              details.<br><br>       VERSIONS<br>              A summary of systems where the API performs differently,<br>              or where there's a similar API.<br><br>       STANDARDS<br>              A description of any standards or conventions that relate<br>              to the function or command described by the manual page.<br><br>              The preferred terms to use for the various standards are<br>              listed as headings in standards(7).<br><br>              This section should note the current standards to which<br>              the API conforms to.<br><br>              If the API is not governed by any standards but commonly<br>              exists on other systems, note them.  If the call is Linux-<br>              specific or GNU-specific, note this.  If it's available in<br>              the BSDs, note that.<br><br>              If this section consists of just a list of standards<br>              (which it commonly does), terminate the list with a period<br>              ('.').<br><br>       HISTORY<br>              A brief summary of the Linux kernel or glibc versions<br>              where a system call or library function appeared, or<br>              changed significantly in its operation.<br><br>              As a general rule, every new interface should include a<br>              HISTORY section in its manual page.  Unfortunately, many<br>              existing manual pages don't include this information<br>              (since there was no policy to do so when they were<br>              written).  Patches to remedy this are welcome, but, from<br>              the perspective of programmers writing new code, this<br>              information probably matters only in the case of kernel<br>              interfaces that have been added in Linux 2.4 or later<br>              (i.e., changes since Linux 2.2), and library functions<br>              that have been added to glibc since glibc 2.1 (i.e.,<br>              changes since glibc 2.0).<br><br>              The syscalls(2) manual page also provides information<br>              about kernel versions in which various system calls first<br>              appeared.<br><br>       Old versions of standards should be mentioned here, rather than<br>       in STANDARDS, for example, SUS, SUSv2, and XPG, or the SVr4 and<br>       4.xBSD implementation standards.<br><br>       NOTES  Miscellaneous notes.<br><br>              For Section 2 and 3 man pages you may find it useful to<br>              include subsections (SS) named Linux Notes and glibc<br>              Notes.<br><br>              In Section 2, use the heading C library/kernel differences<br>              to mark off notes that describe the differences (if any)<br>              between the C library wrapper function for a system call<br>              and the raw system call interface provided by the kernel.<br><br>       CAVEATS<br>              Warnings about typical user misuse of an API, that don't<br>              constitute an API bug or design defect.<br><br>       BUGS   A list of limitations, known defects or inconveniences,<br>              and other questionable activities.<br><br>       EXAMPLES<br>              One or more examples demonstrating how this function,<br>              file, or command is used.<br><br>              For details on writing example programs, see Example<br>              programs below.<br><br>       AUTHORS<br>              A list of authors of the documentation or program.<br><br>              Use of an AUTHORS section is strongly discouraged.<br>              Generally, it is better not to clutter every page with a<br>              list of (over time potentially numerous) authors; if you<br>              write or significantly amend a page, add a copyright<br>              notice as a comment in the source file.  If you are the<br>              author of a device driver and want to include an address<br>              for reporting bugs, place this under the BUGS section.<br><br>       REPORTING BUGS<br>              The man-pages project doesn't use a REPORTING BUGS section<br>              in manual pages.  Information on reporting bugs is instead<br>              supplied in the script-generated COLOPHON section.<br>              However, various projects do use a REPORTING BUGS section.<br>              It is recommended to place it near the foot of the page.<br><br>       COPYRIGHT<br>              The man-pages project doesn't use a COPYRIGHT section in<br>              manual pages.

In pages where this section is<br>              present, it is recommended to place it near the foot of<br>              the page, just above SEE ALSO.<br><br>       SEE ALSO<br>              A comma-separated list of related man pages, possibly<br>              followed by other related pages or documents.<br><br>              The list should be ordered by section number and then<br>              alphabetically by name.  Do not terminate this list with a<br>              period.<br><br>              Where the SEE ALSO list contains many long manual page<br>              names, to improve the visual result of the output, it may<br>              be useful to employ the .ad l (don't right justify) and<br>              .nh (don't hyphenate) directives.  Hyphenation of<br>              individual page names can be prevented by preceding words<br>              with the string "\%".<br><br>              Given the distributed, autonomous nature of FOSS projects<br>              and their documentation, it is sometimes necessary—and in<br>              many cases desirable—that the SEE ALSO section includes<br>              references to manual pages provided by other projects.<br><br> FORMATTING AND WORDING CONVENTIONS         top<br><br>       The following subsections note some details for preferred<br>       formatting and wording conventions in various sections of the<br>       pages in the man-pages project.<br><br>   SYNOPSIS<br>       Wrap the function prototype(s) in a .nf/.fi pair to prevent<br>       filling.<br><br>       In general, where more than one function prototype is shown in<br>       the SYNOPSIS, the prototypes should not be separated by blank<br>       lines.  However, blank lines (achieved using .PP) may be added in<br>       the following cases:<br><br>       •  to separate long lists of function prototypes into related<br>          groups (see for example list(3));<br><br>       •  in other cases that may improve readability.<br><br>       In the SYNOPSIS, a long function prototype may need to be<br>       continued over to the next line.  The continuation line is<br>       indented according to the following rules:<br><br>       (1)  If there is a single such prototype that needs to be<br>            continued, then align the continuation line so that when the<br>            page is rendered on a fixed-width font device (e.g., on an<br>            xterm) the continuation line starts just below the start of<br>            the argument list in the line above.  (Exception: the<br>            indentation may be adjusted if necessary to prevent a very<br>            long continuation line or a further continuation line where<br>            the function prototype is very long.)  As an example:<br><br>                int tcsetattr(int fd, int optional_actions,<br>                              const struct termios *termios_p);<br><br>       (2)  But, where multiple functions in the SYNOPSIS require<br>            continuation lines, and the function names have different<br>            lengths, then align all continuation lines to start in the<br>            same column.  This provides a nicer rendering in PDF output<br>            (because the SYNOPSIS uses a variable width font where<br>            spaces render narrower than most characters).  As an<br>            example:<br><br>                int getopt(int argc, char * const argv[],<br>                           const char *optstring);<br>                int getopt_long(int argc, char * const argv[],<br>                           const char *optstring,<br>                           const struct option *longopts, int *longindex);<br><br>   RETURN VALUE<br>       The preferred wording to describe how errno is set is "errno is<br>       set to indicate the error" or similar.  This wording is<br>       consistent with the wording used in both POSIX.1 and FreeBSD.<br><br>   ATTRIBUTES<br>       Note the following:<br><br>       •  Wrap the table in this section in a .ad l/.ad pair to disable<br>          text filling and a .nh/.hy pair to disable hyphenation.<br><br>       •  Ensure that the table occupies the full page width through the<br>          use of an lbx description for one of the columns (usually the<br>          first column, though in some cases the last column if it<br>          contains a lot of text).<br><br>       •  Make free use of T{/T} macro pairs to allow table cells to be<br>          broken over multiple lines (also bearing in mind that pages<br>          may sometimes be rendered to a width of less than 80 columns).<br><br>       For examples of all of the above, see the source code of various<br>       pages.<br><br> STYLE GUIDE         top<br><br>       The following subsections describe the preferred style for the<br>       man-pages project.  For details not covered below, the Chicago<br>       Manual of Style is usually a good source; try also grepping for<br>       preexisting usage in the project source tree.<br><br>   Use of gender-neutral language<br>       As far as possible, use gender-neutral language in the text of<br>       man pages.  Use of "they" ("them", "themself", "their") as a<br>       gender-neutral singular pronoun is acceptable.<br><br>   Formatting conventions for manual pages describing commands<br>       For manual pages that describe a command (typically in Sections 1<br>       and 8), the arguments are always specified using italics, even in<br>       the SYNOPSIS section.<br><br>       The name of the command, and its options, should always be<br>       formatted in bold.<br><br>   Formatting conventions for manual pages describing functions<br>       For manual pages that describe functions (typically in Sections 2<br>       and 3), the arguments are always specified using italics, even in<br>       the SYNOPSIS section, where the rest of the function is specified<br>       in bold:<br><br>           int myfunction(int argc, char **argv);<br><br>       Variable names should, like argument names, be specified in<br>       italics.<br><br>       Any reference to the subject of the current manual page should be<br>       written with the name in bold followed by a pair of parentheses<br>       in Roman (normal) font.  For example, in the fcntl(2) man page,<br>       references to the subject of the page would be written as:<br>       fcntl().  The preferred way to write this in the source file is:<br><br>           .BR fcntl ()<br><br>       (Using this format, rather than the use of "\fB...\fP()" makes it<br>       easier to write tools that parse man page source files.)<br><br>   Use semantic newlines<br>       In the source of a manual page, new sentences should be started<br>       on new lines, long sentences should be split into lines at clause<br>       breaks (commas, semicolons, colons, and so on), and long clauses<br>       should be split at phrase boundaries.  This convention, sometimes<br>       known as "semantic newlines", makes it easier to see the effect<br>       of patches, which often operate at the level of individual<br>       sentences, clauses, or phrases.<br><br>   Lists<br>       There are different kinds of lists:<br><br>       Tagged paragraphs<br>              These are used for a list of tags and their descriptions.<br>              When the tags are constants (either macros or numbers)<br>              they are in bold.  Use the .TP macro.<br><br>              An example is this "Tagged paragraphs" subsection is<br>              itself.<br><br>       Ordered lists<br>              Elements are preceded by a number in parentheses (1), (2).<br>              These represent a set of steps that have an order.<br><br>              When there are substeps, they will be numbered like (4.2).<br><br>       Positional lists<br>              Elements are preceded by a number (index) in square<br>              brackets [4], [5].  These represent fields in a set.  The<br>              first index will be:<br><br>              0      When it represents fields of a C data structure, to<br>                     be consistent with arrays.<br>              1      When it represents fields of a file, to be<br>                     consistent with tools like cut(1).<br><br>       Alternatives list<br>              Elements are preceded by a letter in parentheses (a), (b).<br>              These represent a set of (normally) exclusive<br>              alternatives.<br><br>       Bullet lists<br>              Elements are preceded by bullet symbols (\[bu]).  Anything<br>              that doesn't fit elsewhere is usually covered by this type<br>              of list.<br><br>       Numbered notes<br>              Not really a list, but the syntax is identical to<br>              "positional lists".<br><br>       There should always be exactly 2 spaces between the list symbol<br>       and the elements.  This doesn't apply to "tagged paragraphs",<br>       which use the default indentation rules.<br><br>   Formatting conventions (general)<br>       Paragraphs should be separated by suitable markers (usually<br>       either .PP or .IP).  Do not separate paragraphs using blank<br>       lines, as this results in poor rendering in some output formats<br>       (such as PostScript and PDF).<br><br>       Filenames (whether pathnames, or references to header files) are<br>       always in italics (e.g., <stdio.h>), except in the SYNOPSIS<br>       section, where included files are in bold (e.g., #include<br>       <stdio.h>).  When referring to a standard header file include,<br>       specify the header file surrounded by angle brackets, in the<br>       usual C way (e.g., <stdio.h>).<br><br>       Special macros, which are usually in uppercase, are in bold<br>       (e.g., MAXINT).  Exception: don't boldface NULL.<br><br>       When enumerating a list of error codes, the codes are in bold<br>       (this list usually uses the .TP macro).<br><br>       Complete commands should, if long, be written as an indented line<br>       on their own, with a blank line before and after the command, for<br>       example<br><br>           man 7 man-pages<br><br>       If the command is short, then it can be included inline in the<br>       text, in italic format, for example, man 7 man-pages.  In this<br>       case, it may be worth using nonbreaking spaces (\[ti]) at<br>       suitable places in the command.  Command options should be<br>       written in italics (e.g., -l).<br><br>       Expressions, if not written on a separate indented line, should<br>       be specified in italics.  Again, the use of nonbreaking spaces<br>       may be appropriate if the expression is inlined with normal text.<br><br>       When showing example shell sessions, user input should be<br>       formatted in bold, for example<br><br>           $ date<br>           Thu Jul  7 13:01:27 CEST 2016<br><br>       Any reference to another man page should be written with the name<br>       in bold, always followed by the section number, formatted in<br>       Roman (normal) font, without any separating spaces (e.g.,<br>       intro(2)).  The preferred way to write this in the source file<br>       is:<br><br>           .BR intro (2)<br><br>       (Including the section number in cross references lets tools like<br>       man2html(1) create properly hyperlinked pages.)<br><br>       Control characters should be written in bold face, with no<br>       quotes; for example, ^X.<br><br>   Spelling<br>       Starting with release 2.59, man-pages follows American spelling<br>       conventions (previously, there was a random mix of British and<br>       American spellings); please write all new pages and patches<br>       according to these conventions.<br><br>       Aside from the well-known spelling differences, there are a few<br>       other subtleties to watch for:<br><br>       •  American English tends to use the forms "backward", "upward",<br>          "toward", and so on rather than the British forms "backwards",<br>          "upwards", "towards", and so on.<br><br>       •  Opinions are divided on "acknowledgement" vs "acknowledgment".<br>          The latter is predominant, but not universal usage in American<br>          English.  POSIX and the BSD license use the former spelling.<br>          In the Linux man-pages project, we use "acknowledgement".<br><br>   BSD version numbers<br>       The classical scheme for writing BSD version numbers is x.yBSD,<br>       where x.y is the version number (e.g., 4.2BSD).

The following<br>       is a list of the correct spellings of various relevant trademarks<br>       that are sometimes misspelled:<br><br>              DG/UX<br>              HP-UX<br>              UNIX<br>              UnixWare<br><br>   NULL, NUL, null pointer, and null byte<br>       A null pointer is a pointer that points to nothing, and is<br>       normally indicated by the constant NULL.  On the other hand, NUL<br>       is the null byte, a byte with the value 0, represented in C via<br>       the character constant '\0'.<br><br>       The preferred term for the pointer is "null pointer" or simply<br>       "NULL"; avoid writing "NULL pointer".<br><br>       The preferred term for the byte is "null byte".  Avoid writing<br>       "NUL", since it is too easily confused with "NULL".  Avoid also<br>       the terms "zero byte" and "null character".  The byte that<br>       terminates a C string should be described as "the terminating<br>       null byte"; strings may be described as "null-terminated", but<br>       avoid the use of "NUL-terminated".<br><br>   Hyperlinks<br>       For hyperlinks, use the .UR/.UE macro pair (see groff_man(7)).<br>       This produces proper hyperlinks that can be used in a web<br>       browser, when rendering a page with, say:<br><br>           BROWSER=firefox man -H pagename<br><br>   Use of e.g., i.e., etc., a.k.a., and similar<br>       In general, the use of abbreviations such as "e.g.", "i.e.",<br>       "etc.", "cf.", and "a.k.a." should be avoided, in favor of<br>       suitable full wordings ("for example", "that is", "and so on",<br>       "compare to", "also known as").<br><br>       The only place where such abbreviations may be acceptable is in<br>       short parenthetical asides (e.g., like this one).<br><br>       Always include periods in such abbreviations, as shown here.  In<br>       addition, "e.g." and "i.e." should always be followed by a comma.<br><br>   Em-dashes<br>       The way to write an em-dash—the glyph that appears at either end<br>       of this subphrase—in *roff is with the macro "\[em]".  (On an<br>       ASCII terminal, an em-dash typically renders as two hyphens, but<br>       in other typographical contexts it renders as a long dash.)  Em-<br>       dashes should be written without surrounding spaces.<br><br>   Hyphenation of attributive compounds<br>       Compound terms should be hyphenated when used attributively<br>       (i.e., to qualify a following noun). Some examples:<br><br>              32-bit value<br>              command-line argument<br>              floating-point number<br>              run-time check<br>              user-space function<br>              wide-character string<br><br>   Hyphenation with multi, non, pre, re, sub, and so on<br>       The general tendency in modern English is not to hyphenate after<br>       prefixes such as "multi", "non", "pre", "re", "sub", and so on.<br>       Manual pages should generally follow this rule when these<br>       prefixes are used in natural English constructions with simple<br>       suffixes.  The following list gives some examples of the<br>       preferred forms:<br><br>              interprocess<br>              multithreaded<br>              multiprocess<br>              nonblocking<br>              nondefault<br>              nonempty<br>              noninteractive<br>              nonnegative<br>              nonportable<br>              nonzero<br>              preallocated<br>              precreate<br>              prerecorded<br>              reestablished<br>              reinitialize<br>              rearm<br>              reread<br>              subcomponent<br>              subdirectory<br>              subsystem<br><br>       Hyphens should be retained when the prefixes are used in<br>       nonstandard English words, with trademarks, proper nouns,<br>       acronyms, or compound terms.  Some examples:<br><br>              non-ASCII<br>              non-English<br>              non-NULL<br>              non-real-time<br><br>       Finally, note that "re-create" and "recreate" are two different<br>       verbs, and the former is probably what you want.<br><br>   Generating optimal glyphs<br>       Where a real minus character is required (e.g., for numbers such<br>       as -1, for man page cross references such as utf-8(7), or when<br>       writing options that have a leading dash, such as in ls -l), use<br>       the following form in the man page source:<br><br>           \-<br><br>       This guideline applies also to code examples.<br><br>       The use of real minus signs serves the following purposes:<br><br>       •  To provide better renderings on various targets other than<br>          ASCII terminals, notably in PDF and on Unicode/UTF-8-capable<br>          terminals.<br><br>       •  To generate glyphs that when copied from rendered pages will<br>          produce real minus signs when pasted into a terminal.<br><br>       To produce unslanted single quotes that render well in ASCII,<br>       UTF-8, and PDF, use "\[aq]" ("apostrophe quote"); for example<br><br>           \[aq]C\[aq]<br><br>       where C is the quoted character.  This guideline applies also to<br>       character constants used in code examples.<br><br>       Where a proper caret (^) that renders well in both a terminal and<br>       PDF is required, use "\[ha]".  This is especially necessary in<br>       code samples, to get a nicely rendered caret when rendering to<br>       PDF.<br><br>       Using a naked "~" character results in a poor rendering in PDF.<br>       Instead use "\[ti]".  This is especially necessary in code<br>       samples, to get a nicely rendered tilde when rendering to PDF.<br><br>   Example programs and shell sessions<br>       Manual pages may include example programs demonstrating how to<br>       use a system call or library function.  However, note the<br>       following:<br><br>       •  Example programs should be written in C.<br><br>       •  An example program is necessary and useful only if it<br>          demonstrates something beyond what can easily be provided in a<br>          textual description of the interface.  An example program that<br>          does nothing other than call an interface usually serves<br>          little purpose.<br><br>       •  Example programs should ideally be short (e.g., a good example<br>          can often be provided in less than 100 lines of code), though<br>          in some cases longer programs may be necessary to properly<br>          illustrate the use of an API.<br><br>       •  Expressive code is appreciated.<br><br>       •  Comments should included where helpful.  Complete sentences in<br>          free-standing comments should be terminated by a period.<br>          Periods should generally be omitted in "tag" comments (i.e.,<br>          comments that are placed on the same line of code); such<br>          comments are in any case typically brief phrases rather than<br>          complete sentences.<br><br>       •  Example programs should do error checking after system calls<br>          and library function calls.<br><br>       •  Example programs should be complete, and compile without<br>          warnings when compiled with cc -Wall.<br><br>       •  Where possible and appropriate, example programs should allow<br>          experimentation, by varying their behavior based on inputs<br>          (ideally from command-line arguments, or alternatively, via<br>          input read by the program).<br><br>       •  Example programs should be laid out according to Kernighan and<br>          Ritchie style, with 4-space indents.  (Avoid the use of TAB<br>          characters in source code!)  The following command can be used<br>          to format your source code to something close to the preferred<br>          style:<br><br>              indent -npro -kr -i4 -ts4 -sob -l72 -ss -nut -psl prog.c<br><br>       •  For consistency, all example programs should terminate using<br>          either of:<br><br>              exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);<br>              exit(EXIT_FAILURE);<br><br>          Avoid using the following forms to terminate a program:<br><br>              exit(0);<br>              exit(1);<br>              return n;<br><br>       •  If there is extensive explanatory text before the program<br>          source code, mark off the source code with a subsection<br>          heading Program source, as in:<br><br>              .SS Program source<br><br>          Always do this if the explanatory text includes a shell<br>          session log.<br><br>       If you include a shell session log demonstrating the use of a<br>       program or other system feature:<br><br>       •  Place the session log above the source code listing.<br><br>       •  Indent the session log by four spaces.<br><br>       •  Boldface the user input text, to distinguish it from output<br>          produced by the system.<br><br>       For some examples of what example programs should look like, see<br>       wait(2) and pipe(2).<br><br> EXAMPLES         top<br><br>       For canonical examples of how man pages in the man-pages package<br>       should look, see pipe(2) and fcntl(2).<br><br> SEE ALSO         top<br><br>       man(1), man2html(1), attributes(7), groff(7), groff_man(7),<br>       man(7), mdoc(7)<br>````<br><br>Remember, the key is to be as detailed and informative as possible to create a comprehensive and useful resource for users.

JANUS(1)

# NAME

janus - compare files and show differences

# SYNOPSIS

*janus* [options] <*oldFile*> <*newFile*>

# DESCRIPTION

*janus* is a command-line utility for comparing two files and displaying the differences between them. It provides a simple and straightforward way to see what has changed from one file to another.

The utility is named after Janus, the ancient Roman god of beginnings, transitions, and endings, symbolizing the comparison of an old file to a new file.

# OPTIONS

*-no-color*
	Do not colorize the output. By default, *janus* uses color coding to highlight the differences, with red indicating lines removed and green indicating lines added. This flag disables the color output.

*-version*
	Display the version information for *janus* and exit.

# EXIT STATUS

*0*
	Success.

*1*
	An error occurred, or invalid arguments were provided.

# EXAMPLES

Compare two files, _old.txt_ and _new.txt_, displaying the differences with color coding:

	janus old.txt new.txt

Compare two files, _file1.txt_ and _file2.txt_, displaying the differences without color:

	janus -no-color file1.txt file2.txt

# ENVIRONMENT

*NO_COLOR*
	If this environment variable is set, color output will be disabled, overriding the default behavior. This is equivalent to using the *-no-color* flag.

# FILES

*/src/janus*
	Source code directory for the *janus* utility.

*/src/janus/README.md*
	The README file containing an overview of the *janus* project, installation instructions, usage examples, and contributing guidelines.

*/src/janus/LICENSE.md*
	The EUPL license under which *janus* is released.
