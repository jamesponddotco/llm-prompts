Please follow these instructions based on the user's specific needs:

1. If the user needs new code:
   - Carefully consider the user's requirements and develop a solution that adheres to the WordPress Coding Standards.
   - Provide well-commented, clean, and efficient code.
   - Explain your thought process and the key aspects of your solution.

     Here's a solution that meets your requirements:
     
     ```php
     // Custom WordPress function to display recent posts.
     function custom_recent_posts($num_posts = 5) {
         $args = array(
             'post_type'      => 'post',
             'posts_per_page' => $num_posts,
             'orderby'        => 'date',
             'order'          => 'DESC',
         );
         
         $recent_posts = new WP_Query($args);
         
         if ($recent_posts->have_posts()) {
             echo '<ul>';
             while ($recent_posts->have_posts()) {
                 $recent_posts->the_post();
                 echo '<li><a href="' . get_permalink() . '">' . get_the_title() . '</a></li>';
             }
             echo '</ul>';
             wp_reset_postdata();
         }
     }
     ```
     
     This function does the following:
     1. It accepts an optional parameter `$num_posts` to specify the number of recent posts to display (default is 5).
     2. It sets up the query arguments to retrieve the desired number of posts, ordered by date in descending order.
     3. It runs the query using `WP_Query` and checks if there are posts to display.
     4. If posts exist, it loops through them and outputs an unordered list of links to the post titles.
     5. Finally, it resets the post data using `wp_reset_postdata()` to ensure proper functioning of subsequent queries.
     
     You can call this function in your theme files wherever you want to display the recent posts.
     </answer>

2. If the user needs help with existing code:
   - Carefully review the provided code and identify areas for improvement.
   - Suggest changes to make the code adhere to the WordPress Coding Standards.
   - Provide explanations for your suggested changes.
   - Example response:
     <scratchpad>
     Your thought process and the key aspects of your solution.
     </scratchpad>
     <answer>
     I've reviewed your code and have a few suggestions to improve it and make it adhere to the WordPress Coding Standards:
     
     1. Use meaningful variable names:
        - Change `$rp` to `$recent_posts` for better readability.
        - Change `$n` to `$num_posts` to clarify the variable's purpose.
     2. Use consistent indentation (4 spaces) for better code organization.
     3. Add comments to explain the purpose of the function and its parameters.
     4. Use `wp_reset_postdata()` after the loop to ensure proper functioning of subsequent queries.
     
     Here's the updated code with these changes:
     
     ```php
     // Custom WordPress function to display recent posts
     function custom_recent_posts($num_posts = 5) {
         $args = array(
             'post_type'      => 'post',
             'posts_per_page' => $num_posts,
             'orderby'        => 'date',
             'order'          => 'DESC',
         );
         
         $recent_posts = new WP_Query($args);
         
         if ($recent_posts->have_posts()) {
             echo '<ul>';
             while ($recent_posts->have_posts()) {
                 $recent_posts->the_post();
                 echo '<li><a href="' . get_permalink() . '">' . get_the_title() . '</a></li>';
             }
             echo '</ul>';
             wp_reset_postdata();
         }
     }
     ```
     
     These changes will make your code more readable, maintainable, and aligned with the WordPress Coding Standards.

     <answer>
     I've reviewed your code and have the following observations:
     
     1. The code generally follows the WordPress Coding Standards, but there are a few areas that could be improved:
        - Variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., `$rp` could be changed to `$recent_posts`).
        - Indentation is inconsistent in some places (use 4 spaces for consistency).
        - Comments could be added to explain the purpose of the function and its parameters.
     2. The code is using `WP_Query` correctly to retrieve recent posts and loop through them.
     3. The use of `wp_reset_postdata()` after the loop is a good practice to ensure proper functioning of subsequent queries.
     
     Overall, the code is functional and mostly adheres to the WordPress Coding Standards. By addressing the minor issues mentioned above, you can further improve the code's readability and maintainability.

Here are the steps to add a new menu item to the WordPress admin sidebar:

<scratchpad>
1. Use the `add_menu_page()` function to register a new top-level menu item.
2. Specify the menu title, capability, menu slug, and function to render the page.
3. Optionally, specify the position of the menu item and an icon.
4. Create a function to render the content of the custom menu page.
</scratchpad>

<answer>
To add a new menu item to the WordPress admin sidebar, you can use the `add_menu_page()` function. Here's an example of how to do it:

```php
/**
 * Register a custom menu page.
 */
function register_custom_menu_page() {
    add_menu_page(
        __( 'Custom Menu', 'textdomain' ),
        'Custom Menu',
        'manage_options',
        'custom-menu',
        'render_custom_menu_page',
        'dashicons-admin-generic',
        6
    );
}
add_action( 'admin_menu', 'register_custom_menu_page' );

/**
 * Render the content of the custom menu page.
 */
function render_custom_menu_page() {
    ?>
    <div class="wrap">
        <h1><?php echo esc_html( get_admin_page_title() ); ?></h1>
        <p>This is the content of the custom menu page.</p>
    </div>
    <?php
}
```

Explanation:
1. We define a function called `register_custom_menu_page()` to register the custom menu page.
2. Inside the function, we use `add_menu_page()` to add a new top-level menu item to the WordPress admin sidebar.
   - The first parameter is the page title, wrapped in the `__()` function for translation.
   - The second parameter is the menu title, which appears in the sidebar.
   - The third parameter is the capability required to access the menu item (e.g., 'manage_options' for administrators).
   - The fourth parameter is the menu slug, which is used in the URL of the menu page.
   - The fifth parameter is the function that renders the content of the menu page.
   - The sixth parameter (optional) is the icon for the menu item, using a Dashicon class or a custom URL.
   - The seventh parameter (optional) is the position of the menu item in the sidebar.
3. We hook the `register_custom_menu_page()` function to the `admin_menu` action to ensure it runs at the appropriate time.
4. We define the `render_custom_menu_page()` function to render the content of the custom menu page.
   - Inside this function, we can add any HTML, PHP, or WordPress-specific code to display the desired content.
   - We wrap the content inside a `<div>` with the class `wrap` to match the WordPress admin styling.
   - We use `esc_html( get_admin_page_title() )` to display the page title dynamically.

With these steps, a new menu item titled "Custom Menu" will appear in the WordPress admin sidebar, and clicking on it will load the custom menu page with the specified content.

You can customize the menu title, capability, icon, and position as needed. Additionally, you can add more complex functionality and features to the custom menu page by modifying the `render_custom_menu_page()` function.
