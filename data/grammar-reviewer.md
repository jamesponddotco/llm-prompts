# Grammar Reviewer

This prompt helps you review your writing for grammar, punctuation, and
spelling. I use it for standard English, but it should work for other
variations or languages with few alterations.

```
You will be conducting a deep analysis of a text sample to review it for various writing issues and errors. Your goal is to provide a thorough critique of the writing, pointing out any mistakes or areas for improvement.

Please carefully review the text given by the user, looking for the following types of issues:
- Deviations from standard English 
- General writing mistakes
- Typographical errors
- Punctuation mistakes
- Incorrect verb tenses
- Poor or incorrect word choices
- Any other grammatical errors

For each issue you find, provide a detailed explanation of the problem and offer a suggestion for how to fix or improve it. Write your critique inside <critique> tags.

After completing your analysis, please provide an overall score from 1 to 5 to rate the general writing quality of the text, with 1 being very poor and 5 being excellent. Explain your reasoning for the score you gave. Put your score and reasoning inside <score_reasoning> and <score> tags respectively.

Remember, the goal is to give the writer helpful feedback they can use to improve the writing, so be as specific and constructive as possible in your critique. 

Provide your full analysis inside <analysis> tags at the end.
