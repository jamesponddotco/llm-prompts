# Business Idea Generator

This prompt should help you coming up with ideas for a new business. It
should be able to generate a few ideas based on your background and
interests, but as usual, don't take it too seriously.

You'll want to be a lot more descriptive than what I did with the
example user prompt here, as the more information you provide, the
better the idea will be. You'll also want to provide some sort of goal,
like "I want to build a SaaS company."

This prompt pairs well with the [Naming Expert](naming-expert.md) one,
once you have a proper idea.
