# LLM Prompts

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-CC0%201.0-green)](LICENSE.md)

This repository contains a curated collection of prompts designed to be
used with [large language models
(LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) to enhance
productivity and streamline various tasks. The prompts cover a wide
range of areas, including coding, writing comments, reviewing grammar,
and more.

While the prompts were originally written and tested using Anthropic's
Claude 3 Opus model, they should be compatible with any LLM.

> **Note:** Unless stated otherwise, use these prompts as system
> prompts, not user prompts. Also, keep in mind that the responses can
> be quite verbose by design and optimizing for cost efficiency was not
> a primary goal when writing the prompts.
